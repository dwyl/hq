# One Metric That Matters
Over the last few months, many opportunities have presented themselves and also a number of projects have been extended for additional sprints and functionality.
As a result, it has sometimes been too easy to get **caught up in the day to day**
or **forget to say no**, making it **hard to focus on the _important_
things** rather than on what's right in front of us or is 'urgent'.  

Our **One Metric that Matters** should be the thing that refocuses our efforts
and reflects what is important to dwyl and dwylers at this moment in time.

> That doesn’t mean there’s only one metric you care about [for the life of the company]. It does, however, mean that at any given time, there’s one metric you should care about above all else.

~ [Lean Analytics Book](http://leananalyticsbook.com/one-metric-that-matters/)

The **most important** thing to _realise_ is that OMTM doesn't tie us into that
metric forever more. As dwyl and our shared objectives evolve, **we _encourage_ a periodic review of these**.

There are (and should be) OMTMs for each branch of the organisation and for individuals
as well. There will be more detailed objectives, but it's _crucial_ to have an OMTM so
that there is a **clear focus and clarity of expectations**.

## _Individual_ Team Members

#### OMTM: Frequency and quantity of _Shared_ learning.

We learn how to do something to solve a particular problem on projects every day
and that's _great_, but if the knowledge goes no further than an individual,
how useful is it and how quickly will you forget it?

> We work together. We build each other up.

The people who _share_ what they know (_i.e. record their findings in issues,
write/contribute to docs, blog posts, records screen casts and write books_)
are the ones who stand out. Sharing _immediately_ demonstrates to your peers
(_and both current & future employers/team mates_) that you are a "Lead Developer"
- your experience and desire to help your team becomes self-evident.

Remember that:
+ There's a _high_ degree of certainty you will forget the details of how you "solved" something
between _writing_ the code and returning to it weeks later. Working your way through
your code will waste your _own_ time re-grokking it
+ 'Others' is not just people within your physical reach. We aim to be a remote-first organisation (meaning you can work from _anywhere_) and we already have a remote community of over 350+ people **actively contributing** to _your_ knowledge
+ Your own learning is **solidified** by teaching
+ When someone takes an hour of their time to write up something that took them a day or a _week_ to figure out and learn, you can now learn it in 30 minutes.
Think about _how much time you have saved_! Pay it forward.


### Shared Learning - How?
Contribute in the form of `dwyl/learn-x` enhancements and implementations of these learnings on dwyl modules/products.

Don't take our word for it, here's **Mattias Petter Johansson** from Spotify: https://youtu.be/RleN-6uMF04

## _All_ Projects & Product

#### OMTM: Number of _Re-useable_ Components created (or used) in the project

If we are not writing _re-useable_ code we are building everything "_from scratch_" each time.

This is worse for the client/customer/user because it takes longer to build (and is
therefore more expensive) and longer to start getting actionable feedback from user testing.
It's worse for all _future_ projects and team mates because it **wastes** _future_ time
of people and projects who have to constantly rewrite similar things.    
It damages our chances of working with clients who are doing _awesome_ things that have
a _real_ social impact because these are also often the clients with the least budget.

### Number of re-useable components - How?
Track this and document at the end of each project.

## Services Projects

#### Additional metric we can't ignore: _User Satisfaction_ with the end-result.
or, if we can't get access to this data:
#### Proxy: _Product Owner Satisfaction_ in the form of a quote and rating

Both of these metrics will feed into the relevant  [**case study**](https://github.com/dwyl/hq/issues/274) for the project/client.

We then also want to integrate that feedback into our processes to make what we do better both for _current_ and _future_ clients.

### User satisfaction/PO satisfaction - How?
In the short term, through surveys that are sent to POs at the end of a project.   
We need to work with our clients to _develop_ a way to help them measure end user satisfaction.



##  dwyl Products

#### OMTM: Number of people who have _used_ the products to **save time** in their lives and feel more _fulfilled_.

Our goal as an organisation is to "[Empower people to sustainably unlock their potential and pursue their passion.](https://github.com/dwyl/phase-two#our-goalmission)"

Our products will be a conduit for this goal so we want to ensure they are making strides towards it.


## Operations

#### OMTM: Ensuring all operating (financial and human) information is available in near realtime through automatisation of systems.

I see the key task towards this as _automating_ as many systems as possible so the data
is available and ***minimises repetitive manual input*** wherever _possible_.
HOWEVER, we also need to do this in such a way that ***minimises tooling*** and keeps
to our 'single source of truth' principle to ensure **frictionless updating**.

"Operations" is not _directly_ responsible for bringing in revenue or _creating_ the
product, but is **critical** to _saving everyone time_ and ensuring that **all** of
the necessary information is _readily_ available so that **informed/good decisions
can be made** e.g. #321.


## Administrative & Sales

#### OMTM: Ensuring all tasks are thoroughly documented and _automated_ wherever possible.

The key for us is to document _all the tasks_ in our organisation, in particular
those that are more repetitive and _find ways to automate them_.

There are _many_ things that dwylers have the potential to be working on and
the more of the 'day to day' tasks that don't require deep work (or thought) that
can be automated, the more time we free up to **live up to our potential and help
others do the same**.
