# dwyl All Hands dinner

## Why?
Through a number of conversations we have been having over the past 4 months, it
has become obvious that even though there *is* a plan for what's happening at dwyl,
each person knows small pieces of the puzzle without being able to see the full thing.

**That needs to be remedied.**

## What?
On 27th March 2017, we're having an organisation-wide catch-up dinner so we can
discuss what's coming up next for dwyl.

Whereas this `md` file will contain an exhaustive list by the 27th, for now it
gives us a place to jot down thoughts and topics on what we want to discuss
and prepare for that night as they come to us in a quick and easy way. :tada:

## Topics to be discussed
This is the master list of topics, some of which will have an obvious owner, others
which may not.

+ [ ] Official welcome to Mark & explanation of role
+ [ ] Successes of the year
  + Feedback from clients
+ [ ] Feedback mechanisms going forward (keep this light, may still be in flux)
+ [ ] Financial overview [Mark]
+ [ ] Context for FTEs and plan going forward (hinges on financials)
+ [ ] Direction for the year
