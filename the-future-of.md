# dwyl All Hands dinner

## Why?
Through a number of conversations we have been having over the past 4 months, it
has become obvious that even though there *is* a plan for what's happening at dwyl,
each person knows small pieces of the puzzle without being able to see the full thing.

**That needs to be remedied.**

## What?
On 27th March 2017, we're having an organisation-wide catch-up dinner so we can
discuss what's coming up next for dwyl.

This `md` file is a place for us to capture thoughts on what we want to discuss
and prepare for that night :tada:
